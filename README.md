An LBSN driven Restaurant Site Recommendation Model- Find your ideal site now! (https://srgpvnysbjy1ft4hhkm0be18dzz2yqcg.vercel.app/)

## Objective

- Identify neighborhoods with:
  - High density of restaurants
  - Their cuisines
  - Customer satisfaction scores

- Develop a recommendation model to:
  - Suggest the ideal site for a restaurant of a particular cuisine.
  - Recommend the ideal cuisines for a given restaurant location to maximize profitability.

- Provide suggestions on the ideal average cost for two for the restaurant recommendations.

This project aims to tackle the challenge of optimising restaurant site selection in Bangalore
by leveraging sentiment analysis and geographic data. Traditional methods of site
selection, relying solely on population density and foot traffic, often fail to consider customer
preferences and local economic conditions, leading to inefficient location choices.
Our approach integrates state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques with location-based
data to create a more data- driven and comprehensive system for restaurant site recommendations.
We employ sentiment analysis, a powerful tool in natural language processing
(NLP), to analyse customer reviews from platforms such as Zomato. By extracting
sentiment from these reviews, we can gauge customer satisfaction and identify which areas
are most frequented and well-regarded by diners. In addition to sentiment analysis,
we utilise geographic data to understand the distribution of restaurants across various
neighbourhoods in Bangalore, identifying underserved areas with potential for new dining
establishments.

To enhance the accuracy of our recommendations, we integrate datasets from Karnataka
government sources and Zomato, which provide insights into population demographics
and economic factors. By combining these datasets, we aim to align restaurant placement
with local demand and economic viability. This project will employ a range of
evaluation metrics to measure our recommendations’ effectiveness and improve restaurant
site selection decision-making. Our work builds on existing research in sentiment
analysis and location-based decision-making while incorporating unique elements tailored
to Bangalore’s diverse and dynamic culinary landscape. Through this project, we aim to
provide a comprehensive framework that will help restaurant owners make more informed,
data-driven site selection decisions.
